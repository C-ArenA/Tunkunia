Selection of a wrong software package can turn out to be costly and adversely affect business processes.

This paper reports a systematic review of papers published in journals and conference proceedings. The review investigates methodologies for selecting software packages, software evaluation techniques, software evaluation criteria, and systems that support decision makers in evaluating software packages. The key findings of the review are: (1) analytic hierarchy process has been widely used for evaluation of the software packages, (2) there is lack of a common list of generic software evaluation criteria and its meaning, and (3) there is need to develop a framework comprising of software selection methodology, evaluation technique, evaluation criteria, and system to assist decision makers in software selection.},

  abstract = {Software reuse is the process of creating software systems from existing software rather than building software systems from scratch. This simple yet powerful vision was introduced in 1968. Software reuse has, however, failed to become a standard software engineering practice. In an attempt to understand why, researchers have renewed their interest in software reuse and in the obstacles to implementing it. This paper surveys the different approaches to software reuse found in the research literature. It uses a taxonomy to describe and compare the different approaches and make generalizations about the field of software reuse. The taxonomy characterizes each reuse approach in terms of its reusable artifacts and the way these artifacts are abstracted, selected, specialized, and integrated. Abstraction plays a central role in software reuse. Concise and expressive abstractions are essential if software artifacts are to be effectively reused. The effectiveness of a reuse technique can be evaluated in terms of cognitive distance—an intuitive gauge of the intellectual effort required to use the technique. Cognitive distance is reduced in two ways: (1) Higher level abstractions in a reuse technique reduce the effort required to go from the initial concept of a software system to representations in the reuse technique, and (2) automation reduces the effort required to go from abstractions in a reuse technique to an executable implementation. This survey will help answer the following questions: What is software reuse? Why reuse software? What are the different approaches to reusing software? How effective are the different approaches? What is required to implement a software reuse technology? Why is software reuse difficult? What are the open areas for research in software reuse?},

Frameworks are collections of libraries and  classes that provide a wide range of capabilities. For front-end and back-end development, there are a  variety of frameworks that support multiple programming languages. Front-end development employs  front-end programming languages to create what the user sees on a website; back-end development  employs back-end programming languages to fulfill those requests on the server side. When used  together, it produces a unified look and feel. The database is where the data for web applications is  stored for usage by back-end frameworks. Choosing the proper combination of front-end and back-end  frameworks is the most critical component of the web development lifecycle. This paper discusses frontend and back-end frameworks. A systematic review was conducted utilizing highly cited publications,  narrowed down to the most recent and relevant works in the research area. This study intends to give  researchers and industry developers a brief reference to web development tools through a critical  review},

  abstract = {With the popularity of software ecosystems, the number of open source components (known as packages) has grown rapidly. Identifying high-quality and well-maintained packages from a large pool of packages to depend on is a basic and important problem, as it is beneficial for various applications, such as package recommendation and package search. However, no systematic and comprehensive work focuses on addressing this problem except in online discussions or informal literature and interviews. To fill this gap, in this paper, we conducted a mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis to understand how developers identify and select relevant open source packages. In particular, we started by surveying 118 JavaScript developers from the npm ecosystem to qualitatively understand the factors that make a package to be highly-selected within the npm ecosystem. The survey results showed that JavaScript developers believe that highly-selected packages are well-documented, receive a high number of stars on GitHub, have a large number of downloads, and do not suffer from vulnerabilities. Then, we conducted an experiment to quantitatively validate the developers’ perception of the factors that make a highly-selected package. In this analysis, we collected and mined historical data from 2,527 packages divided into highly-selected and not highly-selected packages. For each package in the dataset, we collected quantitative data to present the factors studied in the developers’ survey. Next, we used regression analysis to quantitatively investigate which of the studied factors are the most important. Our regression analysis complements our survey results about highly-selected packages. In particular, the results showed that highly-selected packages tend to be correlated by the number of downloads, stars, and how large the package’s readme file is.},

  abstract = {The nature of programming is changing. These changes will accelerate as improved software development practices and more sophisticated development tools and environments are produced. This paper surveys the most likely changes in the programming task and in the nature of software over the short term, the medium term, and the long term.             In the short term, the focus is on gains in programmer productivity through improved tools and integrated development environments. In the medium term, programmers will be able to take advantage of libraries of software components and to make use of packages that generate programs automatically for certain kinds of common systems. Over the longer term, the nature of programming will change even more significantly as programmers become able to describe desired functions in a nonprocedural way, perhaps through a set of rules or formal specification languages. As these changes occur, the job of the application programmer will become increasingly analysis-oriented and software developers will be able to attack a large number of application areas which could not previously be addressed effectively.},
